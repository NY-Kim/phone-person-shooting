# Project Overview
========================================================
A paint ball mini-game where you use your phone as the paint ball launcher and your computer display screen as the canvas. The paint ball mini-game uses Photon for the network connection between the phone and PC, Vuforia for the augmented reality part, and the data from phoneâ€™s gyroscope to keep the phone orientation in sync when the target is not in the camera view. The players will lower their phones to aim, then swipe their finger on the phone screen to launch paint balls, trying to hit the canvas on the PC screen. The speed the you swipe the phone screen determines the speed the paint ball launches.
